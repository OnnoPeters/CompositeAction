# CompositeAction

This repository contains a reusable action, which takes a python version and a python script name with parameters as an input. The python version is installed in a virtual environment along with packages listed in the requirements.txt. If a specific version of a package is required, this can be listed in the Constraints.txt. 

At the end, after the virtual environment is set up, the given python script is run.
